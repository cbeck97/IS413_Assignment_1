    <p class="paragraph">I am very excited for this class. I think what I am most excited about is learning how to actually program applications that can be used. Prior to this class, I feel as though a lot of our programming consisted of learning the basics. We never really built an actual product. I hope to learn how to build applications and also learn skills that will enable me to market myself to future employers.</p>
